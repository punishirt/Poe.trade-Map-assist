# Poe.trade Map assist

### Update v0.4: Added unique maps. 
_Updated the map tiers for the 3.5 Atlas_

### Update v0.2: Added unique maps. 
_**This update requires you to reset your maps.  This will erase the saved completion of maps due to the fact that the way its saved is far from effective, might improve this for future versions.**_




Show a list of maps (per tier) in a sidebar to the left. Search for a map by left-clicking on the map, "toggle" the map by right-clicking it, this will put the map on the bottom of the list, slighly dimmed out.

To Install:

1)  Go to http://tampermonkey.net/ and install.  I am using Google Chrome.
2)  Copy and paste the contents of script.js into a new file and save.
3)  Check out poe.trade and you should see the sidebar appear to your left.
4)  If you no longer need it, just click the tampermonkey icon and disable this script.

Usage:

1)  Left-click a map to perform a search for that map.
2)  Right-click a map to toggle its "completion".
3)  Reset map tiers and their completion by clicking "reset maps" at the bottom of the sidebar.
